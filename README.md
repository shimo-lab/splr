# Sparse plus low rank module
<br/>
Implementation of two classes to handle matrices that can be written as the sum of a sparse matrix and a low rank
matrix.
<br/>
<br/>
The main motivation for this is to be able to efficiently handle sparse data matrices
after centering.<br/><br/>
 
 ## Supported operations
 * Low rank matrices : right and left multiplication by another matrix
 <br/><br/>
 * Sparse plus low rank matrices : right and left multiplication by another matrix
 (singular value decomposition to be implemented soon ...)
